<a id="and-then-came-clojure-clojure" class="anchor" href="#and-then-came-clojure-clojure" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>And then came Clojure (<a href="https://github.com/clojure" class="user-mention">@clojure</a>)...</h3>

<p>In early 2011, David was bitten by the Clojure bug when his friend, Tom Steffes (<a href="https://github.com/smnirven" class="user-mention">@smnirven</a>) introduced him to the language. That lead David to teach himself Clojure and culminated in a self-funded trip to the 2nd annual <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a>, including the excellent Clojure-beginner class preceding the conference. </p>

<a id="along-came-room-key" class="anchor" href="#along-came-room-key" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Along came Room key...</h3>

<p>After the conference, David joined Tom working full-time in Clojure on Colin Steele's (<a href="https://github.com/cvillecsteele" class="user-mention">@cvillecsteele</a>) team at <a href="https://www.roomkey.com">Room key</a> (<a href="https://github.com/roomkey" class="user-mention">@roomkey</a>), a hotel search site with a unique value proposition of direct booking hotels at the lowest possible price. At Room key, David worked extensively on <a href="https://www.roomkey.com">roomkey.com's</a> 100% Clojure back-end API and architected Room key's hotel content application platform. David also created Room key's funnel metrics application running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon Elastic MapReduce</a> utilizing <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">Cascalog</a> to interact with <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop">hadoop</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-now" class="anchor" href="#what-now" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What now?</h3>

<p>Since leaving Room key in early 2016, David has started his own software consulting business, <strong>Thought Manifest LLC</strong> with an emphasis on teaching Clojure to teams and leveraging Clojure to build elegant applications. Most recently, David has been working at <a href="http://www.cognitect.com/">Cognitect</a>, home of the Clojure core team, and Clojure and Datomic creator Rich Hickey (<a href="https://github.com/richhickey" class="user-mention">@richhickey</a>). David helps spread Clojure, empowering teams to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Leap">Quantum Leap</a> ahead of the competition.</p>
