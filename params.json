That lead David to teach himself Clojure and culminated in a self-funded trip to the 2nd annual [Clojure/conj](http://clojure-conj.org/), including the excellent Clojure-beginner class preceding the conference. \r\n\r\n### Along came Room key...\r\nAfter the conference, David joined Tom working full-time in Clojure on Colin Steele's (@cvillecsteele) team at [Room key](https://www.roomkey.com) (@roomkey), a hotel search site with a unique value proposition of direct booking hotels at the lowest possible price. At Room key, David worked extensively on [roomkey.com's](https://www.roomkey.com) 100% Clojure back-end API and architected Room key's hotel content application platform. David also created Room key's funnel metrics application running on [Amazon Elastic MapReduce](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/) utilizing [Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog) to interact with [hadoop](https://github.com/apache/hadoop).\r\n\r\n### What now?\r\nSince leaving Room key in early 2016, David has started his own software consulting business, **Thought Manifest LLC** with an emphasis on teaching Clojure to teams and leveraging Clojure to build elegant applications. Most recently, David has been working at [Cognitect](http://www.cognitect.com/), home of the Clojure core team, and Clojure and Datomic creator Rich Hickey (@richhickey). David helps spread Clojure, empowering teams to make a [Quantum Leap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Leap) ahead of the competition.\r\n",
